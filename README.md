Our data set was provided to us by the Maryland Small Business Development Center (SBDC). The Maryland SBDC for the past couple years has been providing training workshops and business consulting for entrepreneurs with new business ideas or existing businesses. 

We used the dataset provided to us to analyze the data to see how the Maryland SBDC could better target their workshops to their consumer base. We divided and analyzed the data by workshop topic, location, and attendees age, race, and county of residence. The top three most attended events were Business Start-up/Preplanning, Business Plan, Marketing/Sales. There was a category called “none” which upon further investigation and evaluation we learned that the category was actually categorized as only 2 events, both of which were for the hispanic entrepreneur population. This is significant because there could be a potential loss in attendees due to the lack of how the workshops are being conducted in terms of topics, language accessibility, and appropriate advice for a population which may experience barriers due to citizen or resident status. In contrast, the top three most attended events were attended by people who chose not to respond about their race and Black or African American residents. 

From the data analysis performed, we concluded that the implications of allocating more monetary resources towards the top three workshop topics, can increase future attendance. By marketing the top three workshop topics to everyone regardless of race, we can also expect that there would be increased future attendance in the upcoming years. We can also see from the data analysis that there are a significant amount of workshops that have had a historic attendance issue, which needs further analysis into the root cause of low attendance.
